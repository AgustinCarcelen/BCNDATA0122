I am turning this into an example readme. 

### contents: 
* [Introduction](#introduction)
* [Contents](#contents)
* [Conclusion](#conclusion)



### Introduction

this is an example readme which shows how you can create a navigable TOC 

### Contents 

In this section we learn about the concept of content

content is king 

A new term content creator has arisen in recent years. this is not the same as an influencer but social media is a big part of content... it can also apply to video and radio content. 

John Robins lives and breathes content 


## Conclusion 

in conclusion its important to stay consistent with your readme markdown
